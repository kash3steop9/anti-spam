As you should know the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants a number of protections to individuals:

Consider this a formal complaint and request to immediately remove my contact information, and any other identifying information about myself from your systems.

Additionally I revoke your permission to sell, transfer, or otherwise share my information going forward.

Please respond acknowledging your receipt and compliance with this request. If you are unable to comply with this action directly, please provide the contact for CCPA requests, or forward this to said 
contact.

If you do not comply with this request, rest assured I will be filing a complaint with the California Office of the Attorney General.
